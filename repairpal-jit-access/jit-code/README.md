# Implementing JIT (Just In Time Access) 

Prerequisites:

GCS Bucket: Ensure that a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket is already created in your environment to store the Terraform state file.

How to implement Just-In-Time Access

Just-In-Time (JIT) privileged access is a technique employed to handle access to Google Cloud projects in a more secure and streamlined way. This strategy is in harmony with the principle of least privilege, providing users with access only for particular tasks and precisely when necessary.

The purpose is to minimize risks, such as accidental modifications or deletions of resources, and creates an audit trail for tracking why and when privileged access is activated.

To implement Just-In-Time (JIT) access for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform, follow these steps:

Set Up the Terraform Configuration:

Create a Directory: Create a new directory to store your Terraform configuration files.

Create main.tf File: Inside this directory, create a file named main.tf. This file will define the roles and permissions that users will need to access the GCP platform.

Create backend.tf File: Create another file named backend.tf in the same directory. This file will specify the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket where the Terraform state file will be stored.

Create and Configure a GitHub Repository:

Create a GitHub Repository: Set up a new repository on GitHub.
Push Terraform Configuration: Push the directory containing your main.tf and backend.tf files to this GitHub repository.
Commit and Review:

Commit Code: Commit your changes and push them to the repository.
Create a Pull Request (PR): Open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch.
Review and Merge:

Review Terraform Plan: Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to review the Terraform plan. Ensure that the plan aligns with your expectations and that there are no issues.
Merge PR: If the plan looks good, merge your pull request into the main branch.
Just-In-Time Access:

Once the PR is merged, JIT access will be granted according to the roles and permissions defined in main.tf.
